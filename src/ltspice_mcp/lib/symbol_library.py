"""Which file a symbol's name means.

A sheet names a symbol by a bare name (``res``) or by a folder and a name,
which LTspice writes with backslashes (``Opamps\\\\LT1001``). ``find_symbol``
turns that into a file: beside the sheet first, then in each library. It is
the one rule, for the pin geometry the schematic editor works with and for the
body the renderer draws, so the two cannot disagree about whether a part is
there.

The rule is what LTspice 26 and LTspice XVII were recorded doing (the
``symbol-beside-sheet``, ``symbol-named-with-a-folder-it-is-not-in`` and
``symbol-in-library-folder`` cases; ``docs/TESTING.md``, "Recorded LTspice
behaviour"):

- **Beside the sheet** a symbol is found only at the place its name says.
  Neither build looks into a folder under the sheet's for a bare name. For a
  name that says a folder the builds differ: LTspice 26 takes it as written
  and looks in that folder, XVII drops the folder and looks right beside the
  sheet. Both places are tried here, so a symbol either build would find is
  found. That is the safe side to err on: a part whose symbol is not found
  has no pins, and a connection to it goes unseen.
- **In a library** the folder in a name does not bind. Both builds find a bare
  name in any folder of the library, and a name that says a folder the library
  does not have.

Nothing here reads a symbol or keeps a cache; callers do both.
